# Project responsiblity list

## Luca Jungnickel, Role Quality Manager

### Functions and concepts designed and implemented
- robot design
- main NXT programming
    - implemented interfaces for the bluetooth module
    - implementing debugging functions
- designed and implemented an internal state chart for modelling the robot behaviour
- designed and implemented safety requirements via the touch sensors
- specified message types and content which are transmitted between PI and NXT

### Mangement role: Quality Manager
- focused on the embedded quality side
- specified a coding standard for embedded systems at the beginning: https://barrgroup.com/sites/default/files/barr_c_coding_standard_2018.pdf 
- summarized the most important aspects of this coding standard (for our group) and shared that at the beginning:
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mccZKsAIQLhvV3BfLaygU7TVCo0EuYZVr2NfokZLC_s/edit?usp=sharing 
- coding reviews of embedded nxt code with Richard
- designed and implemented safety requirements for the robot: (see in lower half of the state chart)
    - recalibrate the robot if a touch sensor is hit, but this event is unexpected
    - recalibration consists of these steps:
        - driving back to one side
        - counting the number of stones again
        - if the number is correct and the bumber stone is hit: continue normal operation
    - if recalibration failed: stop the robot
